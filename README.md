**Doodle Wizard**

<img src="Gifs/DoodleWizard.gif">

Doodle Wizard is a third-person magical adventure game where players control Felis, a self-conscious wizard sent by the king to retrieve four crystal shards from magical islands. Along the way, Felis uncovers conflicts between the islands and begins to question the kingâ€™s true motives. I led the project and developed a custom sketch recognizer inspired by the PaleoSketch research, allowing players to cast spells by drawing shapes. This system preprocesses sketches, extracts geometric data, and matches it with stored spell templates, creating an interactive and realistic spellcasting experience.

**Skills:** Unity, C#, Clang

**Unit Circle Galaga**

A quick project I developed in a couple of hours for Calculus class. I didn't find any good methods online to memorize the unit circle, so I wanted to gamify the memorization process. 

**Skills:** Unity, C#
